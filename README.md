# SSL / TLS Research Summary

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over networks, especially between clients (like browsers) and servers. SSL is older and now mostly deprecated due to known vulnerabilities, while TLS is its more secure successor with modern improvements in encryption, integrity, and handshake procedures. HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) is more secure than HTTP because it encrypts both the transmitted data and the identity of endpoints, preventing eavesdropping, tampering, or man‑in‑the‑middle attacks. Not using SSL/TLS can expose sensitive user data (passwords, session tokens, personal information) to interception, manipulation, or theft. Chains of incidents—such as certificate expiry outages, expired/weak certificates, or flawed SSL configurations—have led to real‑world service failures and security breaches; for example, the DROWN attack which exploited legacy support for SSLv2 to compromise otherwise secure TLS servers. Requiring HTTPS, using up‑to‑date TLS versions, and keeping certificate handling correct are essential best practices.
